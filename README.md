## UBC Scientific Software Seminar

The UBC Scientific Software Seminar brings together students, graduates, fellows and faculty at UBC to develop software skills for science.

### Fall 2018 Software Projects

People are working on some cool stuff and the goal is to share our projects and to see what everyone is working on. *Everyone is invited!*
